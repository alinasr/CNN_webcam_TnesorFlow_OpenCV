# CNN_webcam_TnesorFlow_OpenCV
CNN for captured images and labels from webcam by Open-CV and trained by Tensor-Flow


in this program first the data(images and labels) will be captured by web cam using OpenCV 
by pressing mouse left button it captures a picture from webcam with 1 label
by pressing mouse right button it captures a picture from webcam with 0 label

it trained a CNN network with all collected data and save the trained network in a folder
then uses the CNN on-line for webcam classification

*This project is an example of implemeting CNN network and using webcam onile streamming. intialy it is not practical with low number of data but with collecting anough data in a period of time it will be more practical for mobile uses

* In the next project we will use pre trained network in case we are unable to collect sufficient data for training
