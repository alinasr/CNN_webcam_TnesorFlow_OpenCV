# CNN_webcam_TnesorFlow_OpenCV
CNN for captured images and labels from webcam by Open-CV and trained by Tensor-Flow


in this program first the data(images and labels) will be captured by web cam using OpenCV 
by pressing mouse left button it captures a picture from webcam with 1 label
by pressing mouse right button it captures a picture from webcam with 0 label

it trained a CNN network with all collected data and save the trained network in a folder
then uses the CNN on-line for webcam classification

* Not that this program is just the demo and it is going to use transfer learning in future because we have less amount of data for our main task
